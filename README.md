# euler-haskell

Solutions to Project Euler problems, as a vehicle for learning
Haskell.

**NOTE**: if you haven't solved these on your own, I strongly advise
closing this tab, getting out your old discrete math textbook (or
maybe Rosen if you don't have one) and an engineering pad, and
crunching through them yourself.

This code is not necessarily idiomatic Haskell, at all! Brutal
criticism welcomed.
